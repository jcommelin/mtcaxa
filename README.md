The Mumford–Tate conjecture for products of abelian varieties
==============================================================

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a finitely generated field $K$
and fix an embedding $K \subset \CC$.
The Mumford–Tate conjecture is a precise way of saying that
the extra structure on the $\ell$-adic étale cohomology groups of $X$
(a Galois representation)
and
the extra structure on the singular cohomology groups of $X$
(a Hodge structure)
convey the same information.

The main result of this paper says that if $A_1$ and $A_2$ are
abelian varieties (or abelian motives) over $K$,
and the Mumford–Tate conjecture holds for
both $A_1$ and $A_2$, then it holds for $A_1 \times A_2$.
These results do not depend on the embedding $K \subset \CC$.

We use techniques from Hodge theory, representation theory, and number theory.
A crucial ingredient is a construction of Deligne [Del79].
